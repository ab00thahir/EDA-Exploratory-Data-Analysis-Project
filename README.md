Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an auto sales dataset to uncover insights into sales patterns, product performance, and customer demographics. The dataset contained various features like product lines, order dates, deal sizes, and customer details.

Key Contributions:
Data Preprocessing:

Encoded categorical features such as ORDERDATE using Label Encoding.
Removed irrelevant columns (ORDERNUMBER, CUSTOMERNAME, etc.) to streamline the analysis.
Data Analysis & Visualizations:

Visualized correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between features.
Used count plots to show sales distribution by country and line plots for sales trends over time.
Created boxplots to observe distribution across numerical features and detect outliers.
Built scatter plots to explore relationships like CITY vs POSTALCODE.
Analyzed deal sizes by product lines with stacked bar charts and country sales distribution via pie charts.
Key Insights:
Correlation between deal size and product line was significant, showing larger deals concentrated in specific product categories.
Country sales distribution revealed top regions for sales and potential market opportunities.
Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
EDA Techniques: Correlation heatmaps, count plots, boxplots, line plots, pie charts, scatter plots, bar charts
